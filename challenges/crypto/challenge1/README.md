# Cryptography Challenge 1: Julius' Jumbled Love Letter

## Challenge Description:
Legend has it that Julius Caesar wrote this cryptic message after drinking too much ancient Roman wine. Unfortunately, he shifted all the letters by 7 because, well, math was hard.

### Encrypted Message:
`JhlzhySvclzWpggh`

Good luck!

### Flag Format:
`CTF{decrypted_message}`
